SmartFinder Application
SmartFinder is a comprehensive full-stack project that combines the best of modern frontend and backend technologies. It's built with a React and TypeScript frontend, paired with a robust Django backend.

Tech Stack
Our tech stack is designed to provide a seamless development experience. Here's what we're working with:
    Frontend: We're using React, TypeScript, and either Vite or Next.js, depending on your setup. This allows us to build fast, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces.
    Backend: Our backend is powered by Django and Django REST Framework, providing a solid foundation for building robust APIs and handling complex business logic.
    Package Manager: We're using npm for frontend dependencies and pip for backend dependencies, making it easy to manage and install packages.

Setting Up SmartFinder on Your Local System
Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the main branch of the repository using Git:
git clone -b main https://github.com/Manoj230305/smartfinder.git

Step 2: Navigate to Project Folders
After cloning, you'll find separate folders for the backend and frontend:
backend/
frontend/

Step 3: Set Up Backend
Navigate to the backend folder and follow the instructions:
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
Make sure to install any dependencies required by the backend, the required dependencies are mentioned in requirements.txt file.

Step 4: Set Up Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder and follow the instructions:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
This will install the required dependencies and start the frontend development server.
That's it! You should now have SmartFinder up and running on your local system.
